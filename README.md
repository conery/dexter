Its main features are:

* the use double-entry bookkeeping to categorize expenses

* a workflow that focusses on efficiency, with extensive use of command completion, edit operations triggered by single keystrokes, and automatic fills based on patterns and previous records

* a new budget model that allows for zero-based budgeting entirely within the double-entry bookeeeping framework, without requiring virtual transactions or other extensions

* a database API that allows users to write their own scripts

Dexter is written entirely in Python and can be installed with a `pip` command that pulls the sources from the GitHub repo.

The only external dependence is MongoDB.
