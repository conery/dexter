# Recap

> [!NOTE] Envelope Budgeting in Dexter
>
> * Envelopes are **expense** accounts, not assets.
>
> * When a budget transaction fills envelopes it **credits expense accounts** and **debits income accounts**.
>
> * A transaction that debits an expense account automatically uses funds from that envelope; no additional transactions are required.
>
> * The balance of an expense account represents the amount of money in the envelope.
>
> * Budget transactions lead to a new meaning for the balances of expense and income accounts, but it's easy to filter out these transactions to recover the traditional meanings.
